# House Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.com. The main steps involved in this project include data understanding, data cleaning, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of model accuracy.

# Data
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.com. It consists of various features related to houses, such as the year of built, garage, area, location, and other relevant factors. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate predictions.

# Data Understanding
To begin with, the data was loaded into the project using the pandas library. This allowed for easy manipulation and analysis of the dataset. Various exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to gain insights into the data, such as examining data distributions, identifying outliers, and assessing correlations between variables. This step was crucial in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset.

# Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset. The pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used extensively to carry out these tasks. By ensuring the data was clean and consistent, we minimized the potential impact of outliers or erroneous values on the accuracy of the prediction models.

# Data Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning models, the dataset underwent preprocessing to transform the data into a suitable format for model training. This involved feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The preprocessing steps were essential for preparing the data to be fed into the machine learning models accurately.

# Model Training
The scikit-learn library was utilized for training multiple machine learning models on the preprocessed data. Various regression models were trained, including linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, and gradient boosting regression. The models were trained on the training dataset to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the features and target variable (house prices).

# Model Evaluation
To evaluate the accuracy and performance of the trained models, cross-validation and the calculation of the R2 score were employed. Cross-validation helps in assessing the generalization capability of the models, while the R2 score quantifies the closeness of the predictions to the actual house prices. After evaluating the models, it was determined that the gradient boosting regression model yielded the highest accuracy and was selected as the final model for price prediction.

# Predictions
Using the selected gradient boosting regression model, the house prices for the test dataset were predicted. These predictions were made based on the features provided in the test dataset and the learned patterns from the training dataset. The predicted prices can be further analyzed and compared with the actual prices to evaluate the model's performance.
